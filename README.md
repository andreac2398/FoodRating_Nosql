# FoodRating_Nosql

Description

This project revolves around the evaluation of food establishments across the United Kingdom by the UK Food Standards Agency, which assigns food hygiene ratings. Commissioned by the editors of a food magazine, Eat Safe, Love, the aim is to analyze this ratings data to assist journalists and food critics in determining focal points for future articles. MongoDB serves as the database backbone, seamlessly integrating data from diverse sources to construct a comprehensive repository of UK restaurants.
